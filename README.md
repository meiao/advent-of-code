[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar where each day a programming puzzle is revealed.
The difficulty of the puzzles increase as the days pass.

This repository contain the code I wrote to solve these puzzles. While I try to write good, clean code, this is not the best example of my code.
Sometimes I stay awake after midnight just to solve them, or will take some time between dinner and bed to solve. So it is kinda rushed.

As much as I can, I want to try to come back to the code and make it cleaner, add more tests and all that.
